It’s gonna be an “accountability bot” for the study rooms (Astro-generated voice channels) in my server.

1. User will join a study room (generated voice channel)

2. Bot will ask member to send a session goal in “Accountability” text channel.

3. The session goal must be sent within 5 minutes, otherwise, user will be disconnected. 

4. Bot will remind member after two hours about the goal and ask for another session goal.

5. The session goal must be sent within 5 minutes, otherwise, user will be disconnected.

This will be applicable to all voice channels in the study category, automatically generated by Astro.
:_utilitiesx: @user I noticed that you haven't posted a session goal in #╰・session yet. Please do so within 5 minutes, otherwise you will be kicked out from the study room.

:_utilitiescheck: @user Thank you for posting your session goal: insert session goal here. Good luck! I will check your progress later and will ask you to post another goal after one hour.

:_error: @user It's been one hour since you posted your last session goal. Did you finish it? If yes, please post a new session goal. If no, kindly repost it.  Please do so within 5 minutes, otherwise you will be kicked out from the study room.
